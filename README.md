# Rope Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a simple physics-based simulation of a rope, written in C++ with Python used for visualization.  
The rope is modeled as a series of connected mass points influenced by spring forces, gravity, and basic constraints to maintain the rope's structure.

The goal of this project is to explore basic physics simulation techniques, and to separate the concerns of simulation (C++) and visualization (Python).
